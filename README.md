# Project 2: Chore Buddy

For this project, we have created an app that allows families to create chore lists, display the list of users and their associated chores, update the list by marking chores as they are completed, and then deleting them.

## Getting started

In order to run this app for testing and development purposes, you will need to execute the following commands from the CLI while in the Project-2 folder:

$ npm install

In the config.json file, you will need to change the username and password to your own for the development object.
